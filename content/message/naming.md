Hello! My hardworking brain has done research while I was busy, coming to several profound conclusions about register naming! I've compiled a FAQ and I hope this becomes the new team standard!

**Should register names describe what's _inside_ them?**

No! Registers are hardware constructs and should have standardized names! You can't just call a register whatever you want!

**Should register names be descriptive?**

Yes! They should indicate _which_ register they are! For instance, register #1 should be named "uwu," since it is the first register.

**Should register names be creative?**

Of course! We at Subrose are champions in innovation, and we will bring the same spirit to designing a new standard register naming convention.

**How many registers should I use?**

You should use **exactly 16**, since that is how many are in hardware. Namely, the first 31 should always be numbers, which are word-sized, while the last register should always be a string, corresponding to the machine's heap memory.

### Register naming standard

Below is a list of how you should always, without exception, name each register:

* Register #1: uwu
* Register #2: owo
* Register #3: owu
* Register #4: uwo
* Register #5: lol
* Register #6: lmao
* Register #7: lmfao
* Register #8: rofl
* Register #9: lolrofl
* Register #10: rofllmao
* Register #11: rofllmfao
* Register #12: rotfllmfao
* Register #13: lmaool
* Register #14: lmfaool
* Register #15: rotfl
* Register #16: rotfllmao

I've been researching this for a month now, so I think my results are final and there are NO mistakes. You may use my discoveries as long as you credit me. Patent pending.
