Hey, glad I could give you a quick overview of our codebase.

Based on our conversation, I came up with some pointers:

* Remember that you can jump to the end of a procedure!
* Use the arrows around instructions to insert more
* If you paste a group of nodes between procedures, you can remap the registers they use.
* If you're failing the internal tests for a task, then you should randomize a bunch of test cases until you fail. The internal tests use the same generator.
* If you need to make many changes, possibly across procedures, the easiest way might be to edit the SUBTXT directly
* Pasting nodes will insert them after the current selection

Good stuff, I'll see you around.
