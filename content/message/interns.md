Dear interns at Subrose,

It's been a few weeks, and I'm so pleased to see you working hard to make a positive impact. Your efforts will be rewarded, not monetarily, but with the possibility of a return offer! But, of course, not everyone will be this lucky. Some simply aren't cut out for the life we have planned for them. You'll need to prove your worth with sweat, skill, and most importantly, **copious overtime**.

It might come as a surprise to hear that our most valuable assets aren't senior engineers like me. Instead, our weekend warriors who commit their entire lives to this endeavor are the real GOATs. Your dedication isn't just about being productive! Your mere presence realizes our company culture, pressuring others to keep up the grind. I highly encourage scheduling sync-ups at night, on weekends, and especially both!

Since we make databases, we've already made one for employee time-tracking, which clearly isn't used for pay. In fact, it's no secret that this metric is a major factor in the decision you'll receive at summer's end. Don't try to game the system! It's heavily overengineered: your score is holistic, based on hundreds of variables. And don't worry, I promise the formula is accurate. :)

Good luck! I can't wait to see you surpass our expectations (at a minimum).
