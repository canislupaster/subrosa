Some of you might not remember, but tomorrow is my birthday! And as your designated food provider, that means I finally get a break. Bring a cake. If, for some reason, you don't remember my dietary preferences: no sugar. I'm diabetic.

I expect to see you and your cake tomorrow! I can't wait to see who comes with the best cake. It may even impact your luck in my lotteries!
