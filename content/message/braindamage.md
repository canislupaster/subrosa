Hi all, this is my first team-wide email! I sure hope I don't mess anything up... ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡

As you may have seen, I keep a hammer on my desk. Whenever my code looks too smart for future me to understand (a common issue for us developers ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡), I just bring out the hammer. Problem solved!

I highly recommend this approach to anyone who feels like they have a voice inside their head. I think this might be a personality disorder, so I like to shut it off with my hammer! ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡

*Tip: to apply the hammer, simply aim for the scalp and let your arm drop.*

Well, I hope this helps. Goodbye~ ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡
