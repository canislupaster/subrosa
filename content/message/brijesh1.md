I'm in charge of amenities here and I've been theorizing lately. After much whiteboarding, I'm proud to achieve a new standard in office lunch catering.

Background: I have a cost limit, but also people to feed. If the theoretical minimum number of people -- 1 person -- comes to lunch tomorrow, I can offer you a fine dining experience. Wedding-grade. But we'll need to institute a strict limit, lest undeserving folks might wander in the door.

It follows that I'll be instituting a new lottery system. Those who don't get the full experience may instead partake of my homemade potato chips -- straight from my backyard, so you know they're safe! If you're lucky, and careful when swallowing, your chip could contain a golden ticket, which admits one to the cafeteria on the printed date. I think this is pretty effective, since it simultaneously rewards those who:

* Rely on the free lunches (so they eat more chips)
* Appreciate my culinary creations (and hence carefully consume chips)
* Haven't gone to my restaurant in a while (since they will eat more chips in the meantime)

I think we will all benefit from this arrangement. Thank you for your support and you're welcome for the food.
