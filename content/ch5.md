Lunchtime. You filter into the cafeteria, ready to savor more of Brijesh's homemade potato chips. You don't see Mikah. Is he sick? Did he finally get a haircut? You hope he can recognize you in the sea of people, but it's always been the other way.

The television is characteristically impertinent, droning on budget cuts and spouting nationalist propaganda.

"Our government will no longer waste taxpayer dollars on programs, contracts, and grants that do not serve our national interests. Starting today, we're cutting funding to the foreign airlines that have long held a monopoly on transport between our homeland and Pala."

Nationalism requires courage. But this administration is cowardly, incapable of even touching Pala. How much longer until Hamilton Wang stands up for Pala? You tune the grating voice out, finish your coffee, and head back to your desk.

The office feels spare. Mikah still hasn't come in, and you also note Ishan's desk is deserted.

Settling into your chair before beginning an hours-long refactoring task, you email Karen about Mikah. [pause]She shoots back instantly: "Mikah isn't with us anymore." You feel your heart pound, further amplified by your recent dose of caffeine.

"Why?" you send.[pause]

Within seconds, [pause]"bad culture fit."

[pause]You look around, unsettled. Karen looks deliberately focused on her workstation. Mikah would have told you about this. You take out your phone and try to call him.

[speed 0.1]"The number your calling isn't registered on a network."[speed 1]

You double check the number, call again, same thing. That's never happened before. Did your friend only lose his job, or did you lose your best friend? Another message rolls in.

[pause]"sorry we didn't get the chance to send him or ishan off. anyways, we definitely need that code cleaned up by tonight for tomorrow's briefing."

Drowning out the paranoid suspicions, you immerse yourself in the cold details of a substantial rewrite.

The intrusive thoughts return when you reenter the subway station. It's impossible to convince yourself that Mikah and Ishan were fired for unrelated reasons right after you used Ishan's workstation and took that drive from Mikah, or that Mikah just... tapped out after such a major event. The doors shut, the train rattles to a stop, and you're in front of your apartment.

You push your apartment door open. A letter shoved in the door glides to the floor, twirling through the air. But it's not your friend -- it's the food bank bouncing your donations back, you surmise when you see the stack of checks. You pull out the paper underneath.

"Your support has been vital to our efforts in feeding our local community. However, after downsizing to a point we once thought impossible, further restrictions prevent us from operating in any capacity. We simply cannot survive in the current political climate."

They've succumbed to the cuts in welfare spending. The sense of loss doubles in your gut. You should relax, go outside, take a walk. No. Damn reason. No, you're going to do something big. You open your desk drawer and unfold the entries you printed from the registry.
