It's Friday, 7 AM. The guitarist is jamming away on the platform again. Your hear his melody swell as you come closer. This time, he recognizes you and smiles. Judging by the money already present, you've doubled his salary. It's been a wild first week.

Mikah agreed to meet you on your way to work, to "clear some things up." You wait on a cold steel bench with spiky anti-homeless dividers, watching the trains screech to a halt, only to accelerate back to speed and immersing yourself in the jazzy improv session. Having gotten the internship earlier, Mikah lucked out on a apartment within walking distance to the office, so you spot him coming down the stairs. He walks past you and you follow him down another set of stairs.[pause]

A deserted basement. The trains here were shut down long ago, and the platform has been abandoned. A dim emergency exit sign illuminates a bare concrete hall. The cracks in the floor dive into the darkness of the track pit, a portal to the void. Trains faintly rumble through the station above. Disused furniture litters the room. Mikah discovers a cushy couch, and you both recline.

"How do you know about this place?"

Your voice is shuttled down the endless track, lost in the vantablack depths.[pause]

"I've done a bit of exploring in the neighborhood. But I'm not here to show you around this place.[pause]

"I've had access to the codebase for weeks now, and after a lot of digging, I found something. The government is in the shitter. I'm scared of them taking more control over Subrose, especially with the new contract. If you're planning on anything, my intel should help, but I'm not going any further than this. Sorry man, but I can't risk anything. I need to keep my job.[pause]

"Anyways, I was looking through the commit histories for some of the top keycoders, and I found a block of commented-out code originally by Cyril Sharma. Yeah, *him*. Apparently, it fetches from an internal legacy API without guardrails. I managed to privilege-escalate and get access to an outdated **SUBKEY** registry. Everyone, every business, and their **SUBKEY** encryption black-box as of five years ago."[pause]

You're stunned. Not only at his monumental discovery, but that Mikah isn't as complacent as you suspected. He already jeopardized his job in hope of making a *real* change. If everyone was like that, what would happen?

"I-I didn't imagine this. Thank you. I really want to check this out. How do I get access?"[pause]

He passes you a flash drive.

"It's all here. Do what you think is right. I trust you."

He checks his watch, fumbles to make out the time in the dark.

"It's five minutes till. Let's go."[pause]

Stepping out of the station after being confined to the basement's dim red glow, everything seems brighter.

You walk into the office with Mikah, and Karen momentarily locks eyes with you. Why the hostility?

You plug in the flash drive. As always, the port is upside down, but you think twice before flipping the drive. This is sensitive stuff. Remembering his password, you remotely open a shell in Ishan's workstation and mount the drive there.

A CSV file is loaded into RAM. It's a simple two-column spreadsheet linking each entity, a person or company, and their **SUBKEY** encryption program in **SUBTXT** assembly. Invaluable data that only keycoders should have access to. You select some interesting individuals and submit a print job. You remember how often Karen looks your way and quickly close the sheet, swiveling your chair. For the time being, she's distracted, talking with Mikah in her office. You close the shell and take a break from your desk to pocket the sheet from the printer.

Out of curiosity, you search through the scant code that Cyril contributed to this branch of Subrose, hoping to pinpoint where Mikah made the discovery. But there's no "commented-out code," even in the revision history. It doesn't exist. You look back at Karen's office. Mikah is gone. He's not at his desk either. Karen glances at you again, betraying the same searing glare. Your chair squeaks as you turn around and refocus on your screen.
