Just like most things in life, it happened slowly, then all at once.[pause]
It's a warm April day, yet your summer prospects are chilly. Your college's computer science building hums with mentions of companies, big and small, from Subrose Systems to obscure hardware startups trying to pack megabytes into on-device flash drives.

Scrolling through message boards on the latest smartphone bought with money better spent on next semesterâ€™s tuition, you aren't hoping for much. In the absence of a better option, you would continue handling logistics for your local food bank.

All at once, *"Ding!"* goes your inbox.[pause] Opportunity strikes: "Interview Request from Subrose Systems." Mikah actually came through with his referral. The interviews pass in a haze.

The sunny coastal city is a welcome respite from bitter midwest winds. All the Hawaiian shirts in the country have seemingly found their home in this particular district of the bay. Mere steps away from the water, Subrose's steel-and-glass pyramid obscures the sun. It's a quiet Tuesday. Employees soundlessly file into elevators, everything falling into its right place. You enter the lobby and ascend to the eighth floor to meet your team lead and skilled keycoder, Karen.

Her words snap back into focus just as Karen stops drilling on fire evacuation plans and dress code. She reaches underneath her desk, pulling out a little slip of paper whose very texture feels fine-grain, rich. The font is a mixture of neo-brutalism, constructivism, and a few other -isms. Their design team is clearly thriving. Your inner voice blurs into TV static as your long-form comprehension neurons engage:

"Welcome to the family! Here at Subrose Systems..."

There are more beanbags than office chairs and every desk has more than one chair. You find your desk among a sea of lookalikes. The card directs you to your first task: it's time to learn **SUBTXT**, the future of assembly programming and the backbone of Subrose's massive infrastructure.
