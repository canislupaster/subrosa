The television mounted by the kitchen blares inconsiderately with media selected by the administration.

"What's on your mind?"[pause]

Today the President announced a defense contract with Subrose Systems, as if they didn't already have a monopoly everywhere else. Is it normal to have megacorps span every sector, shuffling data away into their gigantic stores?

Sometimes, I wonder about the world beyond our borders. I dream of Pala, a global superpower without the corruption and inequality plaguing our country. Widespread poverty replaced with technology out of our reach. Encryption without reliance on a centralized database and breakable ciphers.[pause] You swallow the slurry of homemade potato chip stuck in your mouth.

"Not much."[pause]

Mikah glances at you.

"Look, I know you have more moral backbone than me. You worked at a food bank, you volunteer for charities, you're always *doing* something about it. This can't be comfortable. But this is the only pathway to creating change.[pause] I'll explain more later. Somewhere else," he adds, surveying the bustling cafeteria.[pause]

"Aren't we all complicit, then?"[pause]

"Not if you do something about it. I can't tell you here, though."[pause]

"Can you at least tell me who uses our software?"[pause]

"No, only Karen knows that. She's the liason for our clients. I'll catch you later."[pause]

Disappointed, you nod. He stands, looks at you questioningly, and walks away. The only voice left is from the President.[pause]

"We're settng our sights on bringing accountability and transparency to federal spending and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. We've already saved taxpayers billions of dollars. But we want think our administration can be leaner.

"State-of-the-art research indicates that cutting welfare spending can help get unemployed citizens back on their feet. Our expert economists have identified this as a major source of inefficiency, and changes will be effective in the near future."

Unable to stomach the words, you head back into the office.

Karen walks up to your desk agains, rests her hand on your terminal.

"Are you sure you're not moving too fast?"[pause]

You're exceptional. Though your internship began weeks later, you've almost caught up to Mikah.[pause]

"I think I'm good."[pause]

"Ok, well, you're not supposed to go through training that quickly. I'll have to make someone give you a tour of the codebase and more tasks before you finish."

Deal closed without negotiating, high-heels clacking briskly, she leaves again. What the hell was that?

<StoryParagraph>
You half-heartedly shake Ishan's hand and take a seat at his station. He pulls up his editor and idly pokes through the <code>net-rw</code> listing.

"Yeah, so the part I work on is bioinformatics research."[pause]

"Aren't we on the same product? The predictive analytics engine?"[pause]

"Yep -- we support DNA sequences, so you can upload those and predict based on that."[pause]

"It's just research? Is this code online?"[pause]

"For now, just research. But we hope it might be used to warn people about any potential conditions they might have.[pause] We go live next week."

*We hope.*[pause] Isn't that fantastic? You need to find out who your customers are. Ishan expends an hour tabbing through files and outlining the engine, just one of many addons to the core Subrose database. Finally, you have access to the code. You note that the code quality is down the drain by your standards. It's a team effort, and Ishan is merely average. It's like he started programming yesterday, though he ostensibly has years of experience.

You frown at what you've seen while scouring the codebase, and on a whim, spin around in your chair. Karen is staring at you from behind the glass partition, expressionless. She's on the phone and instantly averts her gaze. The news isn't good: she seems like she's going to explode. How long has she been looking at you? God, you hate the open office plan.
